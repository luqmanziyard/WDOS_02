                        <p>In the present day, Yala is a popular wildlife reserve that is home to a wide variety of animal, bird, reptile and plant life. However, the region of Yala once belonged to a thriving ancient kingdom – the Kingdom of Ruhuna. It is also believed to have been home to a species of ancient beings, as well as a tribe of indigenous people. For some undiscovered reason, the territory was abandoned by humans and became overrun with the wilderness possibly after the 13th century. Discover the past of Yala
